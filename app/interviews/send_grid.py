stack vs queue

different implementations stack vs queue

algorithm - what would you use to implement recursion and why?

implicit call stack vs queue;

breadth-first traversal is for queue;

hashing time complexity - O(1) look-up;


concurrency vs parallelism;
concurrency is usually on a single machine, as multi-threading or a multi-processing;

race condition - when does it occur? double-checked locking or synchronization.

example of time you learnt ; ruby twitter project ;

data to make decision for yourself;

either failed a commitment or expectations;

slips - what happened in those instances?

on-board  a team member or a mentor?
on-boarding overall?

characteristics of good operability of software; services in live environment -
logging; resource intensive => should free up and clean-up after itself;

what sort of things help ask someone to troubleshoot production issues?
readable api, testable, modular

challenges in distributed computing env - stack 100s of 1ks of servers in near-real time,
ops at scale

node; durability; consistency; high-availability;

performance issues?
