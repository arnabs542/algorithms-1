Differences between process and thread -

1) Threads are used for small tasks, whereas processes are used for more heavyweight tasks â€“
 basically the execution of applications.

2) Threads within the same process share the same memory address space, whereas different processes
do not.

A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security
context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum
working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single
thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads.

A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. All threads of a process
share its virtual address space and system resources. In addition, each thread maintains exception
handlers, a scheduling priority, thread local storage, a unique thread identifier, and a set of
structures the system will use to save the thread context until it is scheduled. The thread context
includes the thread's set of machine registers, the kernel stack, a thread environment block, and a
user stack in the address space of the thread's process. Threads can also have their own security
context, which can be used for impersonating clients.

Taken from "Parallel and Distributed Programming Using C++" by Cameron Hughes and Tracey Hughes,
Table 4-1:

What is the difference between threads and processes?
The major differences between threads and processes are:

1) Threads have direct access to the data segment of its process; processes have their own copy of
the data segment of the parent process.

2) Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process; processes must use
interprocess communication to communicate with sibling processes.

3) Threads have almost no overhead; processes have considerable overhead.

4) New threads are easily created; new processes require duplication of the parent process.

5) Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process; processes can only
exercise control over child processes.

6) Changes to the main thread (cancellation, priority change, etc.) may affect the behavior of the
other threads of the process; changes to the parent process do not affect child processes.
