Design a "timer" scheduler that can take a number of specified tasks and schedule them for
execution after specified time-interval delay. What would be some of the design considerations to

It is very easy to imagine a complex scheduling system when solving this problem (think cron +
stopWatch + timer). But keep it limited in scope.
