"""
Design an efficient simple dictionary that can be accessed by multiple concurrent users and editors
simultaneously. While the users are looking up for definitions for specific words, the editors are
either creating definitions for new words, or updating the ones for existing words.
There are many more users (readers) of the dictionary than there are editors.
