"""
Cities are connected as a non-cyclic graph.
If a city hosts an important sporting event, all people from neighboring cities come to that city.
Which road is going to be the most congested road?

Observation: If no cycles, graph reduces to a tree. Hosting city becomes the root of the tree.
Most congested road is one of the edges connecting to the root.
