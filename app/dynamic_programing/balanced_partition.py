"""
Partition an array into 2 halves such that the sum of 2 halves is the same.
This is an extension and generalization of SumZero problem.

Examples

arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.

input: 4,1,-5,6,-11,3
output: 4,6,-11 and 1,-5, 3 (both sum to -1)
