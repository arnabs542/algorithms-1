"""
After preprocessing on a file, given a string s, find if it appears in the file as fast as possible
Suffix tree is a trie of all the suffixes of a string.
It takes O(N) space.

Find longest_common_substring of 2 strings using suffix_array.
Deepest node that still has 2 children. Depth in characters of a compressed trie.
Not depth in terms of edges.

He has N^2 algorithm to build suffix tree.

How to use suffix tree to find the longest palindrome?
