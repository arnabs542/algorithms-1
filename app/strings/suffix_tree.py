"""
ukkonen's algorithm is the only algorithm that constructs suffix trees in O(N)
time.

How to solve the longest_repeating_substring? most_repeating_substring is another
standard question.

Substring search is linear using rabin-karp or KMP or suffix-trees.
Generate all substrings and for each substring, identify if it meets certain criteria.
