"""
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

O(2^n)

height of fib(5) = 5 ; ie O(n)

total number of nodes in a complete binary tree of height n = 2^(n+1) - 1

right most side height = n/2; => 2^(n/2 +1) -1

If you're not sure , just say "exponential" and most interviewers will be happy.

How much space will each take?
Its as much as the max height of stack, = O(n)

Optimal solution can be done in O(n) time and O(1) space
GK: The best algorithm just requires O(log n) time.
