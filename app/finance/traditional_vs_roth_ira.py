1) Traditional to ROTH IRA conversion is treated as a distribution that is taxable.

2) The transfer can be in cash or kind (eg - real estate at Fair Market Value at time of distribution).

3) Watch out for additional taxable income at time of distribution.

4) To reverse the tax, you have to convert ROTH back to traditional in a process called recharacterization,
and avoid tax liability.
