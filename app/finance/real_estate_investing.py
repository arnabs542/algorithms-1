SECONDARY LIEN LOAN, UNSECURED-DEBT, SUBORDINATED-DEBT

1) SECONDARY LIEN LOAN - In case of bankruptcy, the primary lenders (primary lien) get the 1st repayment, and then the
secondary lenders will get whatever is remaining. So its more risky investment.

2) SECURED-DEBT - pledge of specific assets of the borrower (e.g., buildings, land, equipment, intellectual property,
receivables and other financial assets). Secured holders can initiate foreclosure of property to recover their debt.
Unsecured creditors dont have right to foreclosure and hence have less collateral backing their investment claim.

3) SUBORDINATED-DEBT - Subordinated debt refers to a class of obligations that are contractually subordinated in ranking
to all of the senior obligations (i.e., general non-subordinated obligations) of the company, whether they are secured
or unsecured.
------------------
NNN - A triple net lease REIT usually invests in real estate where the tenant is responsible for paying the building's
property taxes, insurance and costs associated with maintenance or repairs.

Triple net leased properties are popular investment vehicles for investors seeking STEADY INCOME WITH RELATIVELY LOW
RISK.

PREFERRED EQUITY -

------------------
CAPITALIZATION RATE (aka cap rate) - Experienced real estate investors use this metric as a preferred way to assess ROI
on an opportunity.
------------------
PRIVATE EQUITY investment model fees - management fees of “2&20”—meaning 2% in an annual asset management fee and 20% of
the profit share. VAST MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS DO NOT BEAT THE MARKET.
OVER THE LONG TERM, THE HIGHER THE FEES, THE LOWER THE NET PERFORMANCE.
Minimum investment is usually $100K, like HEDGE FUNDS.

Terms - approximately 10 years lock-in period. May have extension periods.

IRR - Internal Rate of Return: Its a metric to measure profitability of potential investments calculated
with a complicated formula by setting the NPV (Net Present Value) = 0 and solving for r in formula at
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp#ixzz4wqQAkCXy

ASSUMING THE COSTS OF INVESTMENT ARE EQUAL AMONG THE VARIOUS PROJECTS, THE PROJECT WITH THE HIGHEST IRR WOULD PROBABLY
BE CONSIDERED THE BEST AND UNDERTAKEN FIRST.

IRR is sometimes referred to as "economic rate of return” (ERR).

Sometimes cash earned is not re-invested (no compounding), so actual returns maybe lower than IRR. This
measurement correction is accounted for in MIRR thats a few % points lower.
------------------
CASH-ON-CASH RETURN aka CASH YIELD - Its the avg cash earned on cash invested in the property.
 = Annual Dollar Income / Total Dollar Investment

1) This metric is usually used to measure commercial real estate investment performance.

2) it is not a promised return but is instead a target used to assess a potential investment.
In this way, the cash-on-cash return is an estimate of what an investor may receive over the life of the investment.

Example - Suppose the total purchase price of the property is $1 million, and the investor puts $100,000 down
 and borrows $900,000.
 There are closing fees, insurance and maintenance costs of $10,000 the investor also pays out of pocket.

After one year, the investor has paid $25,000 in loan payments, of which $5,000 is principal repayment and the rest is
interest. The investor then decides to sell the property for $1.1 million on the one-year date. This means the
investor's total cash outflow is $135,000, and after the debt of $895,000 is repaid, he is left with a cash inflow of
$205,000. The investor's cash-on-cash return is then: ($205,000 - $135,000) / $135,000 = 51.9%.
