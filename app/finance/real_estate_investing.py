SECONDARY LIEN LOAN, UNSECURED-DEBT, SUBORDINATED-DEBT

1) SECONDARY LIEN LOAN - In case of bankruptcy, the primary lenders (primary lien) get the 1st repayment, and then the
secondary lenders will get whatever is remaining. So its more risky investment.

2) SECURED-DEBT - pledge of specific assets of the borrower (e.g., buildings, land, equipment, intellectual property,
receivables and other financial assets). Secured holders can initiate foreclosure of property to recover their debt.
Unsecured creditors dont have right to foreclosure and hence have less collateral backing their investment claim.

3) SUBORDINATED-DEBT - Subordinated debt refers to a class of obligations that are contractually subordinated in ranking
to all of the senior obligations (i.e., general non-subordinated obligations) of the company, whether they are secured
or unsecured.

CAPITALIZATION RATE (aka cap rate) - Experienced real estate investors use this metric as a preferred way to assess ROI
on an opportunity.
