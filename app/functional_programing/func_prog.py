"""
Notes from talk "Absurdly vast applicability of monoids in javascript" -

1) closed and associative and identity => monoids. 
union of sets if a mnoid but not an intersection. intersection is a semi-group.


  a) closed => chainable

  b) asociative => eval order

  c) identity => fail safe.
---------------------
concat - 

"goodbye".concat(" cruel")

any data structure built entirely from a monoid is a monoid.
--------------
TERMINOLOGIES TO READ - (from category theory) (TODO)
1) monoid homomorphism
2) Cayley's theorem

3) applicative functors
4) endofunctors

5) algebraic groups
6) semi-rings - (useful for speech recognition in state machines)
